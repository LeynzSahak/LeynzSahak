Nice to see you. Welcome to my page!<br>

I'm Safety and Health Practitioner from  Malaysia, currently living in Pasir Gudang, Johor. Graduated from University Technology Malaysia with a PhD in Chemical engineering and Master in Science (Health, Safety & Environment).  

I’m interested in Data science (DS) due to offers a powerful tool for predicting and preventing safety hazards by leveraging the insights gleaned from analyzing vast amounts of data. By identifying patterns and trends, data science can help organizations proactively address potential risks, ultimately creating safer and healthier environments.

Data science can analyze historical data on accidents and injuries to pinpoint areas within a workplace, community, or infrastructure where incidents are more likely to occur. This allows organizations to prioritize safety efforts and allocate resources effectively to those high-risk areas. For example, analyzing traffic accident data can reveal specific intersections with high accident rates, prompting targeted interventions like improved signage, traffic light adjustments, or pedestrian safety measures.
